% Exercise 1.10. Draw in PostScript the following pictures, taken, with
% modifications, from the proof of Proposition I.47 in the standard
% edition of Euclid’s Elements. Of course you might want to look up
% Euclid’s argument first. One thing to keep in mind is that in drawing
% a complex figure, each conceptual component in the program should be
% handled as a unit. A triangle is not just a bunch of line segments,
% but line segments assembled in a particular order and style. You
% should also think here about about using colors in an intelligent way
% to help explain Euclid’s proof.

% I'd like to actually do this by using compass and ruler methods in
% PostScript, but for the sake of getting the exercise done in a way
% that follows the book, I'm going to calculate coordinates for now.

% I'm not completely following the book though, because I need to use
% some variables and procedures, otherwise it's just too much of a mess.

% My plan is to first calculate all of the points in the drawing, and
% then use them to draw the various paths I need 9 coordinates total,
% 3 for the triangle and then two more for each square.
