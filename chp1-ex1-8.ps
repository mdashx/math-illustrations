% Exercise 1.8. Recall that acos(x) is the unique angle between 0◦ and
% 180◦ whose cosine is x. Use Ghostscript to find acos(0.4). (This will
% require thinking a bit about the geometry of angles.) (Some versions
% of PostScript will have acos built in. Do not use it, but restrict
% yourself to getting by with atan.)
