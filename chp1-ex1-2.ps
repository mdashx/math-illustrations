% Exercise 1.2. Run Ghostscript. Draw an equilateral triangle near the
% center of the page, instead of a square. Make it 100 points on a
% side, with one side horizontal. First draw it in outline, then fill
% it in black. Next, make it in turn red, green, and blue with a black
% outline. (You will have to do a few calculations first. In fact, as
% we shall see later, you can get PostScript to do the calculations.)

% -------

% First calculate the points starting at the origin (currently the
% bottom left corner of the page)

% left corners: (0,0) - (0, 100)
% top corner will be: (p, 50)

% 50^2 + p^2 = 100^2

% >>> math.sqrt(7500)
% 86.60254037844386

% (0,0) (86.60254037844386, 50) (0, 100)

% The page is 612 points tall, so I'll move my points up 250 points to
% get close enough to the center

% And 792 pts wide, so +300 points on the x-axis

% (300, 250) (386.60254037844386, 300) (300, 350)

% -----------

% If I were using PostScript functions, maybe I could use rlineto?
